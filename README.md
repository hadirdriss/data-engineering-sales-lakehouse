# data-engineering-sales-lakehouse
Project Overview

This project implements a full Data Lakehouse architecture using Databricks, PySpark, and Power BI.
The goal is to build an end-to-end ETL pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold) that ingests a CSV file, transforms it, aggregates business metrics, and visualizes results in a Power BI dashboard.
